Submit your assignment as a report. You need to do the following for each of the problems to get full points.
1) Program listing with line numbers. [ 15 points ]
2) Create at least 5 test cases and report their output. [ 5 points]

1. QUADRATIC EQUATION
Design and write a Java code that solves a quadratic equation 𝑎𝑥^2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0. HLIGHT - Please use class and object definitions and do not use procedural style.

Let the roots of 𝑎𝑥+𝑏𝑥+𝑐=0 be 𝑝 and 𝑞.

//TODO Show that the following:

𝑝 + 𝑞 = − b/a , and

 𝑝 * 𝑞 = c/a ,

for non-trivial of values of 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐.
NOTE: Make sure that you address that complex numbers as objects.


2. MATRIX OPERATIONS [20 points]
You will create a general MxN matrix where M = number of rows and N = number columns that are specified by the user. Write a generic class of matrix that accepts user-defined N and M as input parameters and generates a random matrix. Each cell of the matrix is a random number. 23 54

Example 1: Consider a 2x2 matrix: A = �98 97� where A[i][j] is a random number between (0,99).
54 43 76
Example 2: Consider a 3x3 matrix A = �12 98 34� where A[i][j] is a random number between (0,99).
38 43 62
Thus generate a random matrix A. Similarly you can generate matrices of other dimensions by specifying user values M and N . Perform your operations on these matrices.
Design and write Java codes that solves the following:
• Matrix Addition (2x2, 3x5)
• Matrix Multiplication (2x2, 3x5)
Show your results with your set of examples. You are free to choose the values of M and N
